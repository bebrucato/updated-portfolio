# Updated-Portfolio

## Let's Get Down To Business
This updated version of my portfolio features an introduction or "about me," three of my most accomplished projects, my current resume and my contact information. On the Home Page is my photo and a brief introduction. If a user clicks the Project link in the nav-bar, it will take them to my Project Page which features my boozyTunes project, the Weather Dashboard project and the Quiz project. Below each project is a button that says "Check it out!" which will deploy the URL of that project in a new window. 

If a user navigates to the Resume Page, they will see a screenshot of my resume along. Beneath the screenshot is a link that says "Download My Resume Here!," which will then deploy a new window with a downloadable PDF of my resume. Now, last but not least... my Contact Page. This page features my location, links to my GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile. There is also my phone number, and when it is clicked, the user will be asked if they would like to make a call to my number, and my email address, which will open an new email message when clicked.
